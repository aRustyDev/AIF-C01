- Make: magazine had an article in the last year about DIY silicon. One approach produces multi-project chips with your share of real estate holding up to about 1k gates. Article mentioned some free design and sim tools. IIRC, there if a free online starter course. Getting a dev board with chip cost a bit over $100 at that time
