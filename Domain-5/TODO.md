# Domain 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance for AI Solutions

## Explain methods to secure AI systems.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Identify AWS services and features to secure AI systems (for example, IAM #task
roles, policies, and permissions; encryption; Amazon Macie; AWS
PrivateLink; AWS shared responsibility model).
- [ ] Understand the concept of source citation and documenting data origins #task
(for example, data lineage, data cataloging, SageMaker Model Cards).
- [ ] Describe best practices for secure data engineering (for example, assessing #task
data quality, implementing privacy-enhancing technologies, data access
control, data integrity).
- [ ] Understand security and privacy considerations for AI systems (for example, #task
application security, threat detection, vulnerability management,
infrastructure protection, prompt injection, encryption at rest and in
transit).

## Recognize governance and compliance regulations for AI systems.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Identify regulatory compliance standards for AI systems (for example, #task
International Organization for Standardization [ISO], System and
Organization Controls [SOC], algorithm accountability laws).
- [ ] Identify AWS services and features to assist with governance and regulation #task
compliance (for example, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, AWS Audit
Manager, AWS Artifact, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Trusted Advisor).
- [ ] Describe data governance strategies (for example, data lifecycles, logging, #task
residency, monitoring, observation, retention).
- [ ] Describe processes to follow governance protocols (for example, policies, #task
review cadence, review strategies, governance frameworks such as the
Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix, transparency standards, team
training requirements).
