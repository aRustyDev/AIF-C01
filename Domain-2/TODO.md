# Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI
## Explain the basic concepts of generative AI.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Understand foundational generative AI concepts (for example, tokens, #task
chunking, embeddings, vectors, prompt engineering, transformer-based
LLMs, foundation models, multi-modal models, diffusion models).
- [ ] Identify potential use cases for generative AI models (for example, image, #task
video, and audio generation; summarization; chatbots; translation; code
generation; customer service agents; search; recommendation engines).
- [ ] Describe the foundation model lifecycle (for example, data selection, model #task
selection, pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, feedback).


## Understand the capabilities and limitations of generative AI for solving business problems.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Describe the advantages of generative AI (for example, adaptability, #task
responsiveness, simplicity).
- [ ] Identify disadvantages of generative AI solutions (for example, #task
hallucinations, interpretability, inaccuracy, nondeterminism).
- [ ] Understand various factors to select appropriate generative AI models (for #task
example, model types, performance requirements, capabilities, constraints,
compliance).
- [ ] Determine business value and metrics for generative AI applications (for #task
example, cross-domain performance, efficiency, conversion rate, average
revenue per user, accuracy, customer lifetime value).

## Describe AWS infrastructure and technologies for building generative AI applications.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Identify AWS services and features to develop generative AI applications #task
(for example, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart; Amazon Bedrock; PartyRock,
an Amazon Bedrock Playground; Amazon Q).
- [ ] Describe the advantages of using AWS generative AI services to build #task
applications (for example, accessibility, lower barrier to entry, efficiency,
cost-effectiveness, speed to market, ability to meet business objectives).
- [ ] Understand the benefits of AWS infrastructure for generative AI #task
applications (for example, security, compliance, responsibility, safety).
- [ ] Understand cost tradeoffs of AWS generative AI services (for example, #task
responsiveness, availability, redundancy, performance, regional coverage,
token-based pricing, provision throughput, custom models).
