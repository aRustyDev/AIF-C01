# Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML
## Task Statement 1.1: Explain basic AI concepts and terminologies.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Define basic AI terms (for example, AI, ML, deep learning, neural networks, #task
computer vision, natural language processing [NLP], model, algorithm,
training and inferencing, bias, fairness, fit, large language model [LLM]).
- [ ] Describe the similarities and differences between AI, ML, and deep learning. #task
- [ ] Describe various types of inferencing (for example, batch, real-time). #task
- [ ] Describe the different types of data in AI models (for example, labeled and #task
unlabeled, tabular, time-series, image, text, structured and unstructured).
- [ ] Describe supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement #task
learning.

## Task Statement 1.2: Identify practical use cases for AI.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Recognize applications where AI/ML can provide value (for example, assist #task
human decision making, solution scalability, automation).
- [ ] Determine when AI/ML solutions are not appropriate (for example, cost- #task
benefit analyses, situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a
prediction).
- [ ] Select the appropriate ML techniques for specific use cases (for example, #task
regression, classification, clustering).
- [ ] Identify examples of real-world AI applications (for example, computer #task
vision, NLP, speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection,
forecasting).
- [ ] Describe supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement #task
learning.
- [ ] Explain the capabilities of AWS managed AI/ML services (for example, #task
SageMaker, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, Amazon Comprehend,
Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly).

## Task Statement 1.3: Describe the ML development lifecycle.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Describe components of an ML pipeline (for example, data collection, #task
exploratory data analysis [EDA], data pre-processing, feature engineering,
model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment,
monitoring).
- [ ] Understand sources of ML models (for example, open source pre-trained #task
models, training custom models).
- [ ] Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API #task
service, self-hosted API).
- [ ] Identify relevant AWS services and features for each stage of an ML pipeline #task
(for example, SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, Amazon
SageMaker Feature Store, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor).
- [ ] Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example, #task
experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing
technical debt, achieving production readiness, model monitoring, model
re-training).
- [ ] Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under #task
the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per
user, development costs, customer feedback, return on investment [ROI]) to
evaluate ML models.
